# Responsive-Portfolio
Homework #2

//About Me page: 

* I started with the about me page (index.html)

* I added the navbar by watching videos on youtube on how to modify the bar and toggle options. Then I copied the navbar on to the Contact, and portfolio HTML pages. 

* I created the container with the card to enter my headshot and text. 
I made the text "muted" to give it a different look without changing the style. 

* The large background immage at the top of the page is in the style.css page. This is how our instructior, Brian advised us to incorporate it. 

* I had a difficult time figring out how to make the page responsive when the screen was extra small. My tutor, John Blackwell showed me on the Bootstrap website the different screen sizes and the "xs" option. Howver, the problem was that I had to write is as "navbar-expand-lg" because we needed the page to condense anytime that the screen was nything else than large. 

* I saved the headshot and the background pictures in the assets folder to ensure that it shows up on the internet.



//Contact page:

* created a header for the page 

* Created a container for the card that will hold the input fields, the card has a margin so that it does not touch the header. 

* My tutor John Blackwell helped me with the responsiveness of the card content and the rows/colums. 

* I tried adding a "I am not a robot" checkbox, but it was throwing off the spacing. I will ask the professor about it. 



//Portfolio page 

* started out by copying the index.html file and removing the content of the card and adding some margin around the card to give it space between the coard and the navbar. 

* added the image holder link in to the card 8 times and gave each img div the same amount of space all around so that the responsive page allows the same amount of space between each icon  without overlapping. 

Note: overall this project took me about 6 hours to ccomplete. I wrote most of the code by following along with some YouTube videos and some copy/paste from bootstrap. I am working on understanding boostrap better. My tutor John Blackwell helped me finetune the pages at the end and he was super helpful.
